To start a software company with 2 people in my batch would be:
1. Tanishq Kumar
2. Tarun Bolisetty

I would choose Tanishq because of his disciplined nature, Tarun for his good communication skills.
Both are trustworthy and very passionate about the work they do.
For starters I would look for these similar traits and then eventually build together.
